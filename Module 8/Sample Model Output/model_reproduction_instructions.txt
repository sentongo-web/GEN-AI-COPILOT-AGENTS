### Model Reproduction Instructions

#### Data Cleaning and Transformation:
- Missing values in the dataset were handled by filling in zeros.
- The `month` feature was inferred from the `week` and `fiscal_year` values when missing.
- One-hot encoding was used for categorical features such as `store` and `product_category`.

#### Feature List and Data Types:
- The features used for training include: fiscal year, month, week, temperature, precipitation, marketing spend, store, promotion, holiday, natural disaster, product category, planned avg selling price, fiscal quarter, unemployment %, core PCE YoY %, Fed Funds %, 30yr Mortgage %, median US home sale price, real disposable personal income, avg US gas prices, WTI crude oil spot, promotion discount, housing starts, U of M consumer sentiment.

#### Hyperparameters:
- Final model: Random Forest Regressor
- Number of trees (n_estimators): 300
- Maximum depth of trees (max_depth): 3
- Random state: 42 for reproducibility

#### Training Methodology:
- The model was trained on data from 2020 to 2024.
- Loss function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Model was validated using 2024 data.

#### Model-Specific Instructions:
- Scikit-learn (version: 0.24.2) was used for training the Random Forest model.
- Other required libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib (for visualizations).
